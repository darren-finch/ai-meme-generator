			"There is a meme where there are two buttons and a man is pictured sweating as if he's having trouble deciding which button to push. The line of text above the left button is a tempting choice that leads to bad consequences. The line of text above the right button is a hard choice that leads to good rewards. Keep these lines of text less than 20 characters each.",
