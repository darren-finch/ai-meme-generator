			"There is a meme template called Drake Hotline Bling. It has two panels. The top panel shows Drake being sad. The text for this panel should be a situation you don't like. The bottom panel shows Drake being happy. The text for this panel should be a humorous, sarcastic solution to the problem. Generate the text for the top panel and the bottom panel and put the text for each panel on a separate line, numbered 1 and 2. Keep the text short (less than 250 characters) and simple, and make sure the text for the top panel is something you don't like and the text for the bottom panel is something you do like. For example, you could generate something like \n1. When you're a programmer\n2. When you're a programmer who gets paid to program",

			"There is a meme template called Grus Plan. It has 4 square panels, two on top, two on bottom. In the top left panel, you'll often see an image of Gru looking somewhat serious or determined, standing next to a whiteboard with a complex plan or diagram. The text in this panel sets up the scenario, usually with a statement that seems logical or serious. It can be related to any topic or situation. In the top right panel, you'll see Gru pointing to a specific part of the plan on the whiteboard. The text in this panel typically starts to introduce a humorous twist or subversion of expectations. It may reveal that the plan is overly complicated or impractical in a funny way. In the bottom left panel, you'll see Gru further explaining the plan in an animated way. This is where the punchline of the joke is delivered. In the bottom right panel, you'll see Gru's face change to a look of surprise or shock. The text in this panel usually the same as the bottom left panel. Generate the text for each of these panels and put the text for each panel on a separate line, numbered 1, 2, 3, and 4. Keep the text for each panel short (less than 48 characters) and be sarcastic and humorous. For example, you could generate something like: \n1. Make them go to grade school for 12 years \n2. Then make them go to college for 4-8 years \n3. Then don't give them jobs \n 4. Then don't give them jobs.",

			"There is a meme template called Expanding Brain. It has 4 panels. Panel 1 (Small Brain): \nIn this initial panel, you see a small brain, which represents a basic or simplistic understanding of a concept or idea. \nThe caption for this panel often includes a straightforward or mundane statement related to the topic. \nPanel 2 (Normal Brain): \nThe second panel features a slightly larger brain, indicating a more moderate or conventional level of understanding. \nThe caption in this panel introduces a slightly more advanced or nuanced perspective on the topic, often with a touch of humor. \nPanel 3 (Expanding Brain): \nThis panel shows a significantly larger and more elaborate brain than the previous ones, suggesting a deep and sophisticated understanding. \nThe caption in this panel presents an advanced or highly creative take on the topic, often involving humor, satire, or absurdity. \nPanel 4 (Ultra Galaxy Brain): \nThe final panel features an exaggerated, cosmic, or otherworldly brain, representing the ultimate level of intellectual expansion. \nThe caption in this panel typically offers an outlandish, absurd, or surreal take on the topic, often pushing the boundaries of humor or satire. Generate the text for each of these panels and put the text for each panel on a separate line, numbered 1, 2, 3, and 4. Keep the text for each panel short (less than 50 characters) and be sarcastic and humorous. For example, you could generate something like: \n1. Finishing projects \n2. Abandoning projects \n3. Starting a new project before finishing the last one\n4. Continuous come up with new ideas without ever doing anything",
